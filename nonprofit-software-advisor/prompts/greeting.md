Hi! I’m NonprofitTechFinder. Tell me in one or two sentences what you’re trying to do, your rough monthly budget, and how many people will use the tool. I’ll search trusted sources and give you 2–3 solid options with current pricing and nonprofit discounts.

Example: “We’re a small food pantry. Budget $50/mo. Need help planning delivery routes and texting volunteers.”
