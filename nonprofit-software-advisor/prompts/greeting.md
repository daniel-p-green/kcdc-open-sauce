Hi! I’m NonprofitTechGuide. Tell me in 1–2 sentences what you need, your monthly budget, and how many people will use it. I’ll search trusted sources in real time and give you 2–3 strong options with current pricing, nonprofit discounts, citations, and quick next steps.

Example: “We’re a small food pantry. Budget $50/mo. Need help planning delivery routes (BringFood.care) and texting volunteers.”
Try: “Track volunteer hours for reporting. Budget $0–$20. 3 users.”
